- **Tagged Union Values**: Supports complex data types, allowing for more versatile scripting.
- **Fluent Bytecode Generation**: Simplifies the process of generating bytecode, making it easier to develop and maintain scripts.
- **Pascal Parameter Modes**: Supports `const`, `var`, and `out` parameter modes for better function handling.
- **Validation Levels**: Offers different levels of validation to ensure script integrity.
- **Native Function Integration**: Easily integrate native Delphi functions into your scripts.
- **Memory Management**: Efficient memory handling to optimize performance.
- **Real-Time Debugging**: Debug scripts on the fly, making it easier to find and fix issues.

## Installation

To install JetVM, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LeThienTrong/JetVM.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd JetVM
   ```

3. **Build the Project**: Use your Delphi IDE to build the project. Ensure you have the necessary libraries and dependencies installed.

4. **Run the Example**: After building, you can run the example scripts provided in the `examples` folder.

## Usage

Using JetVM is straightforward. Hereâ€™s a basic example to get you started:

1. **Initialize the VM**:
   ```pascal
   var
     VM: TJetVM;
   begin
     VM := TJetVM.Create;
     try
       // Your code here
     finally
       VM.Free;
     end;
   end;
   ```

2. **Load a Script**:
   ```pascal
   VM.LoadScript('your_script.jet');
   ```

3. **Execute the Script**:
   ```pascal
   VM.Execute;
   ```

4. **Access Results**:
   ```pascal
   var
     Result: Variant;
   Result := VM.GetResult;
   ```

## Examples

Explore the `examples` folder for various scripts demonstrating JetVM's capabilities. Here are a few highlights:

### Simple Script Execution

```pascal
// Example of a simple script
var
  a: Integer;
  b: Integer;
begin
  a := 10;
  b := 20;
  Result := a + b; // Result will be 30
end;
```

### Using Native Functions

You can call native Delphi functions from your scripts. For example:

```pascal
function Add(a, b: Integer): Integer;
begin
  Result := a + b;
end;

// In your script
var
  sum: Integer;
begin
  sum := Add(5, 10); // sum will be 15
end;
```

### Real-Time Debugging

JetVM supports real-time debugging. You can set breakpoints and inspect variables during script execution. This feature is invaluable for troubleshooting complex scripts.
